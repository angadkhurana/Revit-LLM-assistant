The fire resistance of a building or its structural and non-structural elements is expressed in minutes against a specified fire load which is expressed in kcal/m^2, and against a certain intensity of fire. The fire-resistance test for structural element shall be done in accordance with accepted standards.\\n\\nTable 1 provides the fire resistance ratings of structural and non-structural elements in minutes for different types of construction (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4). The ratings for different structural elements vary based on the type of construction and other specific factors such as fire separation, the element's function (bearing or non-bearing), and whether the element is supporting more than one floor, only one floor, or a roof.\\n\\nFor example, for Type 1 Construction, the fire resistance rating for exterior walls with fire separation less than 3.7 m is 240 minutes for bearing walls and 120 minutes for non-bearing walls. For the same type of construction, the rating for fire enclosures of exits is 120 minutes.\""

       "'The rules mentioned in the context provided also mandate the following requirements apart from counting the total number of certain elements or calculating distance:\\n\\n1. Rules govern the height for different types of buildings according to their occupancy, the width of streets providing approach to the building, permitted floor area ratio (FAR), and permitted open space around or inside buildings.\\n\\n2. Adequate passageway and clearances are required for firefighting vehicles.\\n\\n3. Attention must be paid to factors that limit fire spread when designing openings in fire-resistant walls and floors.\\n\\n4. A doorway or opening in a fire-resistant wall on any floor should not exceed specified dimensions. They also need to be protected with fire-resisting doors of a certain fire rating.\\n\\n5. Escalator openings must have provisions to avoid smoke spill and need to have sprinklers installed on all sides of the cut out opening on each floor.\\n\\n6. Certain systems are required for specific buildings according to their height and occupancy, such as a talk-back system and public address system.\\n\\n7. Buildings above a certain height are not permitted for certain occupancies.\\n\\n8. Installations are required in basements if the area of the basement exceeds a certain size.\\n\\n9. Water for sprinklers should come from both underground static water storage tanks and terrace tanks.\\n\\n10. Certain buildings require sets of pumps of specific capacities.\\n\\n11. The rules also specify requirements for fire prevention, life safety in relation to fire, and fire protection of buildings according to their occupancy.\\n\\n12. The rules also cover egress requirements and protection features necessary to minimise danger to life and property from fire.\\n\\n13. Special provisions are provided for buildings used for specific purposes such as aircraft assembly or other occupancies requiring undivided floor areas.\\n\\n14. There are also requirements for special purpose industrial occupancies and high hazard industrial occupancies.'"

Calculation of distances: This involves measuring the travel distance from the most remote point within a storey or a mezzanine floor along the natural and unobstructed path of horizontal or vertical egress travel to the door to an exit. The travel distance on the floor should not exceed the distance given in the specific table (referenced as Table 5 in the text).\\n\\n2. Number and arrangement of exits: The minimum required number of exits in a building is determined based on occupant load and width required per person as appropriate to the type of exit for respective occupancies. Exits should be placed as remote from each other as possible and arranged to provide direct access in separate directions from any point in the area served.\\n\\n3. Capacity of exit access: The width of corridors, aisles or ramps required for exit access should be sufficient to ensure a smooth flow of occupants to the exit. The calculation of capacity of exit access is determined by specific rules (referenced as 4.4.2.4 in the text). The total capacity of all the respective means of egress serving a floor should be sufficient to allow egress of the entire population of the floor.\\n\\n4. Size and protection of openings: For certain types of construction, an opening in a fire-resistant wall on any floor is limited to a specific area with a maximum height/width. Every wall opening should be protected with fire-resisting doors and the openings in the floors should be protected by enclosures that have a fire resistance of not less than 120 min.\\n\\n5. Clearances for firefighting vehicles: Adequate passageway and clearances for firefighting vehicles are required.\\n\\n6. Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The comparative floor area ratios for different occupancies and types of construction are given in a specific table (referenced as Table 2 in the text).\\n\\n7. Open space requirements: The requirements of open space around the building(s) shall be in accordance with specific provisions of the code. \\n\\nThese principles are necessary to maintain the safety and functionality of the building, and must be strictly adhered to during the construction and maintenance processes.\\n'"
