      "into a maze in the X-Y plane format:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Coordinate System**: Begin by defining your X-Y plane. The X-axis can represent the width of the floorplan, while the Y-axis can represent the height. Each point (x, y) on thi\n",
      " plane corresponds to a specific point on your floor plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Walls as Barriers**: Translate the walls in your floor plan into barriers in your maze. Depending on the resolution of your grid, each wall might occupy one or multiple cells.\n",
      "You can represent barriers in a variety of ways. If you're coding, you could use a two-dimensional array, where each cell has a value of 0 (for open space) or 1 (for a barrier).\n",

      "4. **Generating the Maze**: Start from the entry point and begin carving paths. There are many algorithms to do this, such as Prim's, Kruskal's, or recursive backtracker. Keep in m\n",
      "nd that you should not overwrite the walls/barriers or the exit point.\n",
      "\n",
